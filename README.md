This project is a simple yet interactive blood type diet recommendation website.



The idea is to provide users with quick, personalized food suggestions based on their blood type, through a clean and engaging interface.



When the user visits the website, they are greeted with:



- A clear title explaining the purpose of the page.

- A dropdown menu for selecting their blood type, reducing input errors.

- A prominent “Get Recommendation” button to trigger the result.



The overall design features a dynamic, animated red gradient background, representing blood and energy, with a subtle blur effect to create a modern, polished look.



Once the user selects their blood type and clicks the button, a dedicated result box appears showing:



- Beneficial foods recommended for that blood type.

- Foods to avoid for optimal health.



Only the relevant result is displayed, keeping the interface clean and free of unnecessary information.



From a technical perspective:



The structure is built with HTML.
CSS is used for layout, animated gradient background, and interactive styling.
JavaScript controls the logic for showing or hiding the appropriate result.




The overall approach prioritizes:


- Simplicity in design and interaction.

- Visual appeal through color and animation.

- User-friendly functionality without complex steps.



In short, the project is technically simple but visually engaging and practically useful for users seeking quick dietary guidance.
